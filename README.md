Realtime multiplayer game made with websockets, Nodejs and React. This Project is still WIP and may contains bugs and unfinished features.

## How to play

Enter the lobby and share the generated link with a friend. Once youâ€™re both connected, the game will start.

### Game 1
In the first game mode, both players draw cards. The one who gets closest to the target number wins. But if you go over it, you automatically lose. Since its a bit different than you might know how to play, an introduction will be implemented..

## Tech stack
Since its a learning project my focuse was primarly on improving with websockets.

Frontend: React, Typescript, Tailwindcss, shadcn
Backend: Nodejs, socket.io
Deployment: Frontend is hosted on Vercel, backend production on render.com as Web Service
